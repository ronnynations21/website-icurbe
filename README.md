# website-hepyco
This is another Web Site for the Hepyco Software Company in Ecuador. I´m developing this from the some style than the CEO of the companie gave me for to work over it.
I´m using:
VS Code (tool)
Codeigniter 3+ (But modified with HMVC Pattern)
Javascript
HTMl + CSS + Bootstrap
MySQL (The DB for record all the clients or users in contact with us)

Soon this website will be available with this new code. For the moment is available a version in a static web page in: https://icurbe.com/
Now i´m coding this new website in my local server. Sorry for no to give you access in my Cave. Ja ja ja!!!

Happy coding!!!
